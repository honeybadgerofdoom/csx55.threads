tmuxOverlord.sh: creates a tmux session that has a pane connected to the specified machines.

Before using:
    Update the hosts array to the computers you want to use
    Update tmux-session-name to rename the window (optional)

Prereqs not covered in this readme:
    Having password-less ssh setup between school machines.

    Basic understanding of tmux (basically just ctrl-b to send command to tmux instead of the pane)
    Either add "module load courses/cs555" to your .bashrc, add it to the script commands, or load it
    manually in the tmux session panes. (Recommend adding it to .bashrc)

Recommendations:
    Kill the tmux session everytime you are closing the terminal- it runs in the background so
    detaching or simply closing the terminal is insufficient for ending the tmux process.

Helpful commands for this usage:
    Start the tmux window:
        bash start-tmux-template.sh
    detach from session:
        ctrl-b d
    attach to session:
        tmux attach -t tmux-session-name
    kill session:
        ctrl-b : kill-session
    change pane:
        ctrl-b <arrow>
    toggle layout:
        ctrl-b spacebar
    send commands to all panes:
        ctrl-b : setw synchronize-panes
